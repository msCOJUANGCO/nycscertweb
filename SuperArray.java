/** ***** WHY DO WE WANT A SuperArray ANYWAY? ***** 
Regular arrays are cool.  We can store things in them and we can easily find out how many things we can store in them (capacity). However, if we want to know how many things are *actually* stored in array, we have to do extra work.  

We can keep track with a counter (another variable) to tell us how many elements we've stored in the array.  

If we want many, many arrays to store lots and lots of things, having to keep track of the arrays and each of their counters is annoying.  

So: we're going to write a class that will do this for us.  We can write the class once and then use it many, many times.
**/



/** ***** WHAT WILL SuperArray DO? ***** 

* It will store our information (in this case, integers) and keep count of how many integers we've stored.

With a SuperArray, we can:
  * get the value stored at a specified index
  * set a value at a specific index
  * write the SuperArray as a String, so we can easily print & read it
  * determine how many integers we've stored in our SuperArray (as opposed to the length, which tells us the capacity, not how many integers are stored!)
  * check if the SuperArray is empty
  * increase the size of our SuperArray
  * add an integer to the SuperArray (at the end or at a specified index)
  * remove the integer stored at a specified index from the SuperArray  
*/



/** ***** WHAT DO I DO MAKE A SuperArray? ***** 
* In the skeleton, there is a debug() function.  It is now placed as the last method in this class.  

* According to https://github.com/hunter-teacher-cert/cs-ed-cohort-3-summer-2022/tree/main/daily/6  as of 07.09.22 18:21
(added toString() in Basic as I didn't see it listed)

*
* 	🔰***Basic***
* Add/write:
* >✔️ #0:  SuperArray()
*     Basic constructor that:
      1. Creates a new array of size 10 and assign data to refer to it. 
      2. Sets the numberElements variable to 0.
* >✔️ #1:   SuperArray(int size)
*     Constructor that:
*     1. Creates a new array of size and assign data to refer to it. 
      2. Sets the numberElements variable to 0.
* > ✔️#2:   isEmpty()
*     return true if the SuperArray is empty, false otherwise.
* > ✔️#3:  add(int value)
*     adds value to the end of the SuperArray (after the last added element)
* > ✔️#4:  toString() 
*    return a String version of SuperArray in human-readable format

* 🎒***Intermediate ***
* Add/write:
* > ✔️#0: grow() 
*   Enlarges the SuperArray. It should:
*      Create a new array, 5 units larger
*      Copy the old data to the new array
*      Set the data instance variable to point to the new array
*
* Modify:
* > ✔️#1: add(int value) 
*   Modify code so that if the data array is filled it will:
*     1. Grow the array using the grow method you just wrote.
*     2. Add the new value to the array.
* 
* Add/write:
* > ✔️#2: get(int index)
*     return the value at location index 
*
*
* ✨***Advanced***
* Write:
* > #0: add(int index, int value) 
*     Adds value at location index. You should shift the data to create an open space if you need to and you can use grow() if you need to make the array larger.
* > #1: remove(int index) 
    Removes the location at index by shifting all the elements after location index and subtracting one from numberElements
